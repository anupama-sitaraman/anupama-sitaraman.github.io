Hi! I'm Anupama Sitaraman, and I am a first-year PhD student in Societal Computing at the [Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Yuvraj Agarwal](https://www.synergylabs.org/yuvraj/).

Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) and was mentored by [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/) and [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/).

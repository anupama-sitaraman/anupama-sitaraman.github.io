abstract = {Recent studies have analyzed the carbon footprint
of residential heating and proposed transitioning to electric heat
pumps as an important step towards decarbonization. Electric
heat pumps are more energy-efficient than gas furnaces and use
electric grid power, which is generally less carbon-intensive than
directly burning fossil fuels. The transition to electric heat pumps
only solves half of the problem. Electric grids, in most parts of the
world, are primarily powered by carbon-intensive fossil fuels and
may never be completely carbon-free. Furthermore, the added
electricity demand of heat pumps may trigger expensive upgrades
in the electric grid. A deep decarbonization of residential heating
can be achieved by using co-located solar photovoltaic (PV)
systems with battery storage alongside heat pump retrofits.
However, there is no free lunch and a deeper decarbonization
comes at a significant cost. In this paper, we use data from
4,413 real-world homes to analyze the additional electricity
demand due to heat pumps. We investigate the problem of sizing
solar panels and storage to completely offset the added demand
and investigate the tradeoff between cost and carbon emission
reduction benefits. Our analysis suggests that co-located solar PV
systems are an effective and carbon-free alternative to the power
grid, and can reduce carbon emissions by at least 58%.
